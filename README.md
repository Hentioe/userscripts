# userscripts

Some User scripts written by myself.

## List

- [`WrapperCode.user.js`](https://github.com/Hentioe/userscripts/raw/master/WrapperCode.user.js) - When the Chrome browser is translating a webpage, it may translate the content of the code because part of the code is not wrapped by the code tag. This script can solve this problem.

## You need to know

These scripts are just to solve or enhance my personal web browsing experience, but they are not perfect, and I will not perfect them because I am not interested in them.
